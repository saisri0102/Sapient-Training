         * The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.
         Use Cases of useRef:
            * It can be used to store a mutable value (Mutable is a type of variable that can be changed.) in functional components that does not cause a re-render when updated.
            * It can be used to access a DOM element directly.  
         
         * useRef(initialValue) is a built-in React hook that accepts one argument as the initial value and returns a reference (aka ref). A reference is an object having a special property current.
         * reference.current accesses the reference value, and reference.current = newValue updates the reference value
         * A ref created with useRef will be created only when the component has been mounted and preserved for the full lifecycle.
        * Updating a ref is a side effect so it should be done only inside a useEffect (or useLayoutEffect) or inside an event handler.
         
         There are 2 rules to remember about references:
            * The value of the reference is persisted (stays the same) between component re-renderings;
            * Updating a reference doesn't trigger a component re-rendering.
         
         Keeping a mutable variable 
            * Both in class components and functional components using Hooks, we have two ways of keeping data between re-renders:
            In class components
                1. In the component state: Every time the state changes, the component will be re-rendered.
                2. In an instance variable: The variable will persist for the full lifetime of the component. Changes in an instance variable won’t generate a re-render.
            In functional components
                1. In a state variable: useState or useReducer. Updates in state variables will cause a re-render of the component.
                2. In a ref: Equivalent to instance variables in class components. Mutating the .current property won’t cause a re-render.

        The 2 main differences between references and state:
            * Updating a reference doesn't trigger re-rendering, while updating the state makes the component re-render;
            * The reference update is synchronous (the updated reference value is available right away), while the state update is asynchronous (the state variable is updated after re-rendering).
            
         * */

         // USE CASE 1: Storing Mutable values -> Ex: logging button clicks 
         // The component LogButtonClicks uses a reference to store the number of clicks on a button:
         function LogButtonClicks() {
            const countRef = React.useRef(0);
            
            const handle = () => {
                countRef.current++;
                console.log(`Clicked ${countRef.current} times`);
            };
            console.log('I rendered!');
            return <button onClick={handle}>Click me</button>;
        }

        // USE CASE 2: Accessing DOM Elements
        function App() {
            const inputElement = React.useRef();

            const focusInput = () => {
                console.log(inputElement.current.value);
                inputElement.current.focus();
            };

            return (
                <div>
                    <input type="text" ref={inputElement} />
                    <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
