/**
 * 
bind is a method on the prototype of all functions in JavaScript. It allows you to create a new function from an existing function, change the new function's this context, and provide any arguments you want the new function to be called with


call and apply are very similarâ€”they invoke a function with a specified this context, and optional arguments. The only difference between call and apply is that call requires the arguments to be passed in one-by-one, and apply takes the arguments as an array.
