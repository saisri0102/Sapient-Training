    Importance of label

    The <label> tag defines a label for many form elements.

The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focus on the input element.

The <label> element also help users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together.

<!--
    Importance of Name Attribute
    Notice that each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.
    If the name attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all.

    Form Tag Attributes

    The default HTTP method when submitting form data is GET. 
    NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)

    Notes on GET:

        Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
        NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
        The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
        Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
        GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google
    Notes on POST:

        Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
        POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
        Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked
