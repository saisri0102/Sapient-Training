/**
 * ES6 introduced the new.target pseudo-property that allows you to detect whether a function or constructor was called using the new operator.
 * 
 * If a function is called normally, the new.target is undefined. However, if the function is called using the new keyword as a constructor, the new.target return a reference to the constructor.
 */

/**
 * By using the new.target, you can control how a function will be called.

For example, to prevent the add() function from being called with the new keyword as a constructor, you can throw an error by checking the new.target like this:
 */

 function add(x, y) {
    if (new.target) {
      throw 'The add function cannot be called as a constructor';
    }
    return x + y;
  }
  
  let obj = new add(10, 20);
  console.log(obj);
