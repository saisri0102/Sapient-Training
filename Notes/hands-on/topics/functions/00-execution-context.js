/**
 * Whenever we run javascript first global Execution context is created.
 * What is Execution Context ? 
 * 
 * Execution context (EC) is defined as the environment in which the JavaScript code is executed. By environment, I mean the value of this , variables, objects, and functions JavaScript code has access to at a particular time.
 * 
 * Everything in javascript happens inside execution context
 * 
 * Javascript is synchronous and single threaded language
 * Synchronous & Single threaded: only one command is executed at single time
 */

/**
 * How Execution Context Works ?
 * Execution Context contains two components
    1. Memory component ( Variable Environment ) - 
        - ( Memory is allocated to the variables before executing the code. It is the place where all the variables, functions classes are stored in key: value pair)
    2. Code component ( Thread of Execution)
        - This is the pace where code is executed line by line
